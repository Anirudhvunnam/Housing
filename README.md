In the dynamic world of real estate, making informed investment decisions is a complex challenge. The real estate company's ambition to invest in the burgeoning Nashville area is both exciting and challenging, given the market's volatility and the need to identify value deals that align with their financial goals. This project aims to leverage the power of data analysis and predictive modeling to equip the company with a strategic advantage in identifying properties with favorable value propositions.

The central goal of this endeavor is to create a robust model that accurately distinguishes overpriced and underpriced properties, thereby enabling the real estate company to prioritize its investment decisions. By comprehensively analyzing a dataset containing vital information about recent sales, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that inform the understanding of property value drivers. This project addresses not only the concern of houses going over their asking price but also the broader quest for maximizing value and returns on real estate investments.

Through a multi-step approach, we will explore various predictive modeling techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Each model's performance will be evaluated using rigorous benchmarking metrics to ascertain its efficacy in addressing the company's objectives. With the focus squarely on maximizing returns, our analysis transcends the mere prediction of value discrepancies; it seeks to empower the company with actionable insights into key variables that drive property value. Our ultimate aim is to guide the real estate company towards a model that not only identifies value deals but also illuminates the avenues through which they can extract the most value from their investments in the Nashville real estate market.

By providing evidence-backed recommendations and insights into key variables, this analysis intends to support the real estate company's quest to make strategic, informed decisions that align with their financial aspirations, ultimately translating into a successful and lucrative investment venture.

Dataset:
Housing dataset containing records of house prices in different areas in the United States between the years 2013 to 2016. This dataset contains variables that could influence the pricing of houses, these include the variable 'sale price', variable 'acreage', variable 'city', and so on. By analyzing the dataset, the real estate company can question what causes people to buy properties based on the output of the analysis. Conclusions on the manner in which houses are going over their asking price have to be achieved regarding the overpricing of the properties. To achieve this, the report focuses on interpreting and analyzing the relationship between sale prices and other property records related to it. By doing this, the data analyst can use the conclusions obtained from the analysis, as a reference for accurately pricing properties to attract prospective buyers.
